	            <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My primary research interests lie in the fields of labor and development economics. I will be presenting my job market paper at Southern Economic Association Meeting (session 1.C.32) on Saturday, November 19, 2016. I am available for interviews in the following conferences this year:

	            <h4> Timing of Migration, Immigrant Quality and Labor Market Assimilation: Evidence from a Long Panel in Germany </h4>
	            <p>
	This paper shows that it is important to account for the timing of migration while estimating immigrants' rate of economic assimilation. The length of stay in the host country, which is commonly assumed to be exogenous in existing literature, depends on the timing of migration. As the optimum timing of migration is based on net expected lifetime earnings, the length of stay is also endogenously determined. In this paper, the timing of migration and wage assimilation equations have been modeled and estimated jointly, which is a first in literature. Using German Socio-Economic Panel data from 1984 -2014, the paper estimates the individual-specific rate of assimilation while accounting for unobserved immigrant quality and unobserved propensity of early migration. Estimates from the joint model reveal four key findings. First, the average rate of assimilation estimated under the exogeneity assumption is biased upwards. Second, the average rate of assimilation hides significant variation in assimilation rates between immigrants of different quality. Third, immigrants of low quality have a faster rate of assimilation than their high quality counterparts. Fourth, immigrants with a high propensity of early migration have a higher individual-specific rate of assimilation. The joint model allows us to find the interdependence between the timing of migration and labor market assimilation of immigrants, mechanisms that up until now had been assumed to be independent in literature. </p>
	 
	            <h4> Wage Divergence: Why Does the Gap between Natives and Immigrants Get Bigger? </h4>
	            <p>
	This study examines the evolution of immigrant earnings and employment in Germany and Russia. to We show that the commonly-estimated average returns to post-migration experience hide significant variation in assimilation rates between immigrants with different observed characteristics and unobserved abilities </p>
	 
	            <h4> Old Questions, New Country: Labor Market Assimilation of Immigrants in Russia. </h4>
	            <p>
	The paper revisits the questions of labor market assimilation of immigrants but for an unexplored country, Russia. I use immigrant data in Russian Longitudinal Monitored Survey from 1994-2011 and estimate the individual rates of economic assimilation using the joint model of timing of migration and wage assimilation. The Russian federation has one of the largest stock of immigrants in the world and has an interesting composition of immigrant population. Russia experienced an influx of immigrants after the break-up of Soviet Union and still receives a large number of migrants from former Soviet states. These immigrants, for the most part, are linguistically, ethnically, and culturally similar to the natives. Interestingly, the results are similar to those estimated for Germany (in a supplementary paper) despite the different mix of migrants and different migration policies. Again, the individual rates of assimilation vary significantly and they are inversely correlated with the immigrant quality. These results provide external validity to the findings on immigrant assimilation in Germany.  </p>
