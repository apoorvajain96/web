	            <h4> Timing of Migration and Labor Market Assimilation. </h4>
	            <p>
	In this paper, I identify different patterns of immigrants’ assimilation in the labor market by estimating individual-specific assimilation rates while accounting for immigrants’ innate skills and the timing of migration. </p>
	 
	            <h4> The Economic Assimilation of Immigrants: Comparative Evidence from the Long-Term Panel Studies in Germany and Russia. </h4>
	            <p>
	This study examines the evolution of immigrant earnings and employment in Germany and Russia. We show that the commonly-estimated average returns to post-migration experience hide significant variation in assimilation rates between immigrants with different observed characteristics and unobserved abilities </p>
	 
	            <h4> Old Questions, New Country: Labor Market Assimilation of Immigrants in Russia. </h4>
	            <p>
	The paper revisits the questions of labor market assimilation of immigrants but for an unexplored country, Russia. It analyzes the evolution of earnings and employment of immigrants relative to natives using Russian Longitudinal Monitored Survey for a period of 1994-2011. </p>
	 
	            <h4> Acculturation and its effect on immigrants’ dietary behaviors. </h4>
	            <p>
	The paper uses a life-cycle model of food choices to explain the effect of acculturation on immigrants’ health and to understand the well-documented ‘Immigrant Health Paradox’. </p>
